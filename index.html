            <h3>PWS - Path Waling System</h3>
            <p> PWS is developed inorder to help the freshman students as well as the visitors of Fresno State to get directions from one building to another/ from current location to the building. We used Google Maps API to find the shortest route based on the mode of travel.</p>
            <p>The user is provided with an easy to use interface. Once the user has chose the route he/she wants to go with, the user is then provided with the floorplan image of the desination building making it easier for the user to access whichever room they want to go to.</p>
